Raffles 2 vol P. 75.\nIn endeavouring to trace the origin of this name, there is found in Clough’s Dictionary Page 14 Ajiwaka, a kind of Hindu religious mendicant who goes about naked ​as a proof that he has destroyed his passions. The word is derived from A privative, and Jiwa life, which means thus death, non-existence, a person not troubled with a mundane soul. Saka C. 691 a sovereign, any prince who gives name to an era. Ajiwaka Saka may thus have been contracted into Aji Saka, for both the wa and ka are constructive particles.

The seeds have thin butterfly-wing appendages, and hence the Botanical name Pterocarpus, wing-fruit. The word is evidently Sanscrit, though the nearest approach to it in Clough is only Asanâ C. 66. a seat; also a tree, ficus religiosa, possibly from such tree being holy, and under its shade the seat of holy men. In the Sunda districts it will frequently be found planted in old grave yards or Kramats. The tree grows plentifully throughout the Archipelago, and is said to yield the large slab tables of ​the Moluccos, where it is called Kayu Lengoa Mr. Friederich informs me that in Sancrit Asana has also the meaning of „sitting in some peculiar position, as is the custom of devotees” May the word asana, as the etymon of our Angsana tree have had its origin in this tree being often selected for the place where former devotees chose to sit and meditate, and from this holy character of the tree, it was planted about the graves of the deceased? (15).[15].\n",

Mr. Friederich considers Bantĕn, to be a Krama or refined form for Bali, which by Clough's dictionary, Page 463 implies, Propitiatory offerings, religious gifts or sacrifice- which meaning Mr. F. is of opinion would apply to the island of Bali, since the same meaning attaches to the word Bali in Sanscrit. Mr. F. fancies that Bali was a sort of holy land of the Panditas, devoted to religious purposes and offerings, for which same purpose Bantĕn had originally been employed, but as such was destroyed by Hassan Udin, on the introduction of Mohammedanism. Other words in Javanese make a transfiguration as strange as Bali = Bantĕn, as for instance Kari = Kantun. T. Roorda, Page 172, to remain over; a remainder. Kirim = Kintun. T.

        "word": "Batang, appears to be a nearly obsolete designation for a Deity, or for some superior being connected with old superstitions. The word is still in use among the Badui of South Bantam, who still adhere to a form of worship partly derived from Hinduism, or the former religion of the Javanese. Thus they talk of the Patang Jala or Batang Jala, as one of their chief divinities, and with them occurs the expression, when they are in difficulty or much fatigued, of Hari Batang tulung Maung. The word Batang may be a corruption of Batara which see. Wata, C. 617 among other numerous meanings has that of \"a Tiger, the Bengal tiger\" or the Tiger Royal. The initial W in the Polynesian tongues is often commuted for B. This mutation is also known in Singhalese, Clough Page 454 under the letter B says — \"Considerable difficulties arise from a custom which has gained both among authors and Copyists substituting ​the B for W and vicê versa” a final ang is also frequently added to words, by which the original Wata would become Batang. This appears to be the more probable as this Hari Batang is associated with Maung; the colloquial Sunda word for the Tiger Royal. Batang may also be a corruption of Déwata, with the initial Dé dropped, and ng suffixed. Hari, C. 787 is derived from Hara to take, and is a name of Krishna or Vishnu, Yama or Indra, and the expression Hari batang tulung maung will thus mean — „Oh God Krishna, help me oh Tiger”. Batang Jala may mean the God of magic or delusion. Jala C. 210 magic, conjuring, illusion, supernatural deception. Throughout Java till this moment the natives have a superstitious reverence for the Tiger royal, and will not hurt or kill it, unless it first has dosa or sin, and has killed a human being, or some of his Cattle. Batang is the name of a place and districts on the north coast of Java in the residency of Pakalongan, where the Prahu mountains come down near the shore. In these same Prahu mountains are found many remnants and remains of temples from Hindu times, and the name of Batang may perhaps be in some way connected with the Divinities there formerly worshipped. Another name of a place in this locality which attracts attention as being of Hindu origin is Sraman near Simbang. Clough Page 778 gives Sramana, from Srama to perform acts of austere devotion- an Ascetic, one devoted to meditation for the purpose of obtaining final emancipation from existence; a Buddhist ascetic, a beggar, a religious mendicant, a Buddhist priest.\nBatang may also be explained as derived from Bata C. 455 descent, going down, descent from a hight. To the Sanscrit Bata the Polynesian Ng may have been added as a termination, and Batang may mean the low land, the low country along the foot of the lofty and sacred Prahu mountains, see also Balibat.\n",

Batara Guru, however, on Java appears to have been the chief Hindu Deity worshipped, But whether Siwa or Vishnu is not evident.

On Bali, according to Fricderieh Bat. Trans. Vol 23 Page 10. Bela is the burning of a wife in a fiery hole, separate from her husband. Into this she jumps without\nkrissing herself. Béla has been described by Crawfurd as implying Retaliation, but as far as I (Friederich) can learn, the Bali meaning of the word implies rather the Sanscrit welā, sudden and easy death (Wilson). This becomes plain from the manner in which it takes place, also from the circumstance that the attendants of a chief who has been killed in battle, and who make an amuk and die with him, are\nalso called Béla. In general in Bali the word implies „the act of dying with a superior\",\nas the wife with her husband, the slave with his master, the attendant with his lord.\nThis word is probably derived from Billa, C. 473, a sacrifice of animals to demons, or an offering made in honour of deceased ancestors. In Malay it means to accompany in death ; the voluntary sacrifice of a woman at the funeral of her husband — or it may\ncome from Béla, C. 478, power, strength, force, might.\n",

        "word": "Biang! is an exclamation of surprise, either denoting fear or admiration. Also denoting mistrust, and at the same time half putting the question : Do you think I am such a fool as to believe you? This word is probably of Sanscrit origin, and would be properly represented by abhi hyang! which will mean „the Profound Divinity.“ „The superlative divinity.“ Abhi, C. 39 is a preposition implying similarity, before (in the presence of), separation, severally, wish, desire; also, Conjunction, as belonging to, with respect to etc. Abhi in Compound words implies very, emphatic, before, as Abhikkanta, C. 39 from Abhi, very, kanta, good excellent, good in the highest degree. Abhinya, C. 39 from abhi very, nya Knowledge, profound knowledge, supernatural acquirements. And in the same manner we may form Abhi hyang, the most excellent Divinity, the supernatural Divinity. So also may be explained the name of Abiasa, one of the early sovereigns of Java, see Raffles Vol 2. P. 80. from Yasa, C. 572, fame, glory, celebrity, renown, thus Abhi-yasa, renowned in the highest degree. So likewise in the words Abiseka, which is still current on Bali for the anointing of the Rajahs. Abhi-seka, C. 40 from Abhi before, Sikta sprinkling, an anointing, royal unction; Sikta, C. 730 from Sicha to sprinkle, and kata affinitive-sprinkled, wetted. Abhirupa, abhi, emphatic, Rupa, beautiful, extremely beautiful.[9] ​To return to the Sunda language we have Bianglala a Rainbow. Lala, C. 604 wavering, unsteady, fickle, Abhi-hyang-lala, the most excellent divinity who wavers or is fickle, from the evanescent nature of the rainbow. Abhi-hyang has here again been contracted into Biang. Raffles gives Yang-lalah for the Rainbow in Balinese.\nThat the Sundanese no longer dream of the real meaning of the word Biang! which is nevertheless so often in their mouths, is no wonder, seeing that they have been so long converted to Mohammedanism, and all that they almost know of the former worship of their forefathers is comprehended in the words Agama Buda.\n",

After the conflagration had ceased, certain portions of his bones had survived the operation of the fire; these were carefully collected and deposited with great pomp and solemnity by the priests in a building of this kind, raised for the purpose; afterwards, these sacred relies were divided, and sent over the world, for the purpose of religious veneration; every temple had its Dagaba, and every dagaba has a portion of these bones.[10].\n",
